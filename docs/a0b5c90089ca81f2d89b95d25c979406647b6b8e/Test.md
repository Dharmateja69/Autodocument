## Function: `router`

- **Description:** This function imports the Express.js library and creates a new Express Router instance. Router objects are a lightweight alternative to the full Express application and are used to organize the routes of an Express application.
- **Parameters:** None
- **Returns:** An Express Router instance

```javascript
router.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

router.post('/', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});
```

- **Function: `get` and `post`**
  - **Description:** These are methods provided by the Express Router instance to handle HTTP requests. The `get` method handles GET requests, and the `post` method handles POST requests.
  - **Parameters:** Three parameters: `(req, res, next)`. `req` is the request object, `res` is the response object, and `next` is a function to call the next middleware in the stack.
  - **Returns:** None

```javascript
module.exports = router;
```

- **Function: `module.exports`**
  - **Description:** This is a built-in Node.js function that is used to export the `router` object so it can be used in other parts of the application.
