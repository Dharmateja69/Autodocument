## Function: `test`

- **Description:** Executes a test function, logging a message to the console.
- **Parameters:** None
- **Returns:** No return value

---

## Variables: `s`, `num`, `or`, `rev`

- **Description:** These are local variables used within the `test` function for a palindrome check.
- **Details:**
  - `s` is a string constant set to "sidhu".
  - `num` is an integer variable initialized to 1221.
  - `or` is a copy of the initial `num` value.
  - `rev` is used to store the reversed number.

## Function: Palindrome Check

- **Description:** Checks if the input number is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.
- **Parameters:** None (uses the `num` variable declared outside the function)
- **Returns:** Logs a message to the console indicating whether the number is a palindrome or not.

The function works by reversing the number `num` and comparing it with the original number. If they are equal, the number is a palindrome. Otherwise, it is not a palindrome. The reversal is done by repeatedly dividing the number by 10 and appending the remainder to `rev`. The remainder is the last digit of the number, and the division operation removes the last digit from the number. This process continues until the number has no digits left.
